![UI](./images/deployed-ui.png)

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is a fully containerised, production-ready AI microservice deployed to AWS ECS Fargate, combining advanced NLP, vector search, and agentic automation:

* **Emotion Detection:** Accurately identifies fine-grained emotions (joy, anger, sadness, disgust, fear) from customer feedback using Watson NLP.
* **Semantic Search:** Embeds feedback with SentenceTransformers and stores it in Qdrant, enabling fast, context-aware similarity search.
* **Agentic LLM Workflow:** Integrates OpenAI’s GPT-4 to generate empathetic, context-rich support replies—leveraging both emotion analysis and retrieval-augmented generation.
* **Streaming LLM responses:** Supports real time token streaming from GPT-4o-mini which displays text to client while it is being generated.
* **Microservice Architecture:** Exposes a robust REST API via Flask, supporting analysis, storage, semantic search, and agentic reply generation.
* **Cloud Deployment**: Runs locally via Docker Compose and deployed to AWS ECS Fargate for production-style container orchestration

**Key Skills Demonstrated:**
* Advanced **NLP** and **LLM integration**
* Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agentic workflows
* **Vector database** design and semantic search

## 🧬 Emotion Detection (Watson NLP)
1. Calls Watson NLP API
2. Extracts emotion probabilities
3. Identifies dominant emotion
4. Returns a structured JSON response

Example output:
```bash
{
 "anger": 0.01,
 "disgust": 0.02,
 "fear": 0.05,
 "joy": 0.93,
 "sadness": 0.04,
 "dominant_emotion": "joy"
}
```

## 🔍 Semantic Search (Qdrant + Embeddings)
### Why Qdrant?
Qdrant is a purpose-built vector database designed for fast similarity search.

### How storing works
* Convert text → vector (SentenceTransformer)
* Generate unique ID (uuid4)
* Store vector + metadata payload in Qdrant
* Payload includes both:
    * the raw text
    * the Watson emotion scores

### How searching works
* Convert query → vector
* Perform cosine similarity search
* Retrieve top-k matches with payloads

This enables “find similar feedback” based purely on semantics.

## 🤖 Agent Workflow (LLM-Powered Suggested Reply Generator)
The AI agent workflow combines multiple tools — emotion detection, vector retrieval, and an LLM — to generate helpful, human-like suggested replies to customer feedback.

This endpoint demonstrates real agentic behaviour:
```bash
Tool → Tool → Retrieval → LLM → Structured Output
```

### What the Agent Does
When you call /api/suggest_reply, the system performs a full multi-step pipeline:
1. Detects emotions
2. Retrieves similar feedback
3. Constructs system prompt and a user prompt with context (original text, emotion analysis, similar examples, metadata from vector DB)
4. Calls an LLM (OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini) to generate a short, empathetic, support-style message.
5. Returns structured JSON

Useful for downstream automations or UI handling.

This mirrors the architecture used in real workflow automation platforms (LangGraph, n8n, Zapier + LLMs, custom agent frameworks).

## ⏱️Realtime Streaming
This project supports **token-by-token streaming** from GPT-4o-mini using Flask generators (yield) and the OpenAI streaming API. This enables real-time UI updates (gives the typing effect you see in ChatGPT).

**Why it matters:**
* User gets results faster
* Required for chat-style interfaces
* Mirrors production-grade applications

---


## 🐳 Dockerisation
### Dockerfile
* Python 3.10-slim
* Install dependencies
* Copy source code
* Expose port 5000
* Run Flask server

## docker-compose.yml
Defines two services:
```yaml
services:
  emotion-detection:  # Flask API
  qdrant:             # Vector database
```
* Shared Docker network
* Persistent volume (qdrant_data)
* Automatic rebuild/run using one command

---

## ☁️ Cloud Deployment: AWS ECS Fargate
This service is deployed to **AWS ECS using Fargate** to demonstrate a production-style container deployment without managing underlying servers.

**Why ECS Fargate was chosen:**
- **Serverless container execution** - no EC2 instances or OS management required
- **Easy scaling** by setting task count
-  **Health management** handled by AWS.
- **Clear separation of concerns** between application code and infrastructure
- **Commonly used in production AI and backend systems**

This mirrors how many teams deploy Python-based AI services in real-world environments.

### Deployment highlights:
- Built and pushed Docker image to **Amazon ECR**
- Created ECS **Task Definition** with environment variables injected via the task definition
- Deployed as a **Fargate service** with public networking
- Configured **Security Groups** to expose the API on port 5000
- Injected sensitive configuration (OpenAI API key) via environment variables
- Verified deployment via live /health and API endpoints

### Live Access
The service runs as a publicly accessible ECS task (IP-based access): http://13.60.202.71:5000

> Note: In production, this would typically sit behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB).  
> This deployment focuses on ECS fundamentals, container orchestration, and cloud networking.

### Why this matters
This deployment mirrors how production AI services are run:
- Long-running API services (not scripts)
- Cloud-native container execution
- Secure secret handling
- Infrastructure-aware AI engineering

### Why ECS Fargate
- Serverless containers: no EC2/cluster management required.
- Simple scaling: adjust desired task count; ALB/VPC integration.
- Security by design: IAM roles for tasks and isolated ENIs.
- Cost focus: pay per vCPU/memory; no idle hosts to manage.
- Clean workflow: push to ECR and deploy without managing nodes.
